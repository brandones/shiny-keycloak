# R Shiny with user authentication over HTTPS

I want to use R Shiny to create dashboards to look at health record data from OpenMRS. This tutorial is not specific to OpenMRS. I'll explain how to get R Shiny working with user authentication via ShinyProxy and KeyCloak, all dockerized, all over HTTPS.

#### Notate Bene

We're going to use ShinyProxy with "simple" (insecure) auth available only on the LAN, and set up an instance in the cloud with KeyCloak authentication, with a KeyCloak server we'll also set up in the cloud.

I'm just going to document the fully secured setup -- the insecure setup is a subset of the work.

So far, I've only gotten KeyCloak to work with dockerized MariaDB. Getting it to work with un-dockerized MySQL is a to-do.

## The Stack

* [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R library for producing webapps.

* [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/) is an authorization and orchestration layer. It checks whether a user is authenticated, and if not, sends them to KeyCloak for authentication. It then presents an interface for launching the Shiny apps that the user is authorized to use.

* [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is a crazy powerful user/auth management application, which provides a management console for adding users, a login screen, and a million options.

* [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) will hold the user data, but could also be used for other things (e.g. by the Shiny apps).

* [https-portal](https://github.com/SteveLTN/https-portal) will act as a reverse proxy, securing everything over HTTPS. It runs nginx under the hood and uses letsencrypt for TLS certificates.

## Server Setup

Spin up a server. I'm working on Debain Stretch. I like that it doesn't have the AppArmor weirdness mentioned below.

## Docker Setup

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

Configure daemon to be available at port 2375. Three ways to try doing this, in order of least likely to screw things up:

1. Create a file `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with the following contents:
    ```
    {
        "hosts": [ "unix://", "tcp://127.0.0.1:2375" ]
    }
    ```
    and do a `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart docker`.

2.
    Do `sudo systemctl edit docker.service`.
    Set the file contents to
    ```
    [Service]
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -D -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
    ```
    and do a `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart docker`.

3. Refer to the [ShinyProxy instructions](https://www.shinyproxy.io/getting-started/).

Note that you don't want Docker to yell all-caps security warnings into your syslog, you'll need to
[enable TLS for the docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/). Having gone with
method (1) (after method (2) caused docker to stop working one day), and
creating my keys in `/etc/docker/keys/`, my
[dockerd config file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file)
looked like
```
{
    "hosts": [ "unix://", "tcp://127.0.0.1:2375" ],
    "tlsverify": true,
    "tlscert": "/etc/docker/keys/cert.pem",        
    "tlscacert": "/etc/docker/keys/ca.pem",        
    "tlskey": "/etc/docker/keys/key.pem"           
}
```

On Ubuntu 18.04, I had to [disable AppArmor](https://forums.docker.com/t/can-not-stop-docker-container-permission-denied-error/41142/7) because otherwise Docker containers were unkillable. But this will make snaps fail to start. Good luck.

Add your user to the docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)`

[Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Create the network everything will run on: `sudo docker network create sp-net`

## Get HTTPS-PORTAL and KeyCloak running

You'll need two (sub)domains, one for ShinyProxy and one for KeyCloak. Mine were `sp.domain.com` and `sp-keycloak.domain.com`. Add A records from these (sub)domains to your server's IP address.

Take a look at the [KeyCloak Docker documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/).

Create a docker-compose.yml like the one in this repository. We don't have the KeyCloak credentials-secret,
so we'll only start HTTPS-PORTAL, MariaDB, and KeyCloak for now: `docker-compose up -d https-portal mariadb keycloak`.

This compose file will spin up
- HTTPS-PORTAL exposed at ports 80 and 443 (make sure your firewall is configured such that these ports are exposed; and that they are the *only* ports exposed)
- KeyCloak on `localhost:8010`
- MariaDB (because Docker and MySQL don't get along due to TLS issues)
- (once it's working) ShinyProxy on `localhost:8020`.

HTTPS-PORTAL will route to either ShinyProxy or KeyCloak depending on the URL at which it is accessed.

I wasn't able to get the KeyCloak environment variables for setting database address or database password to work.
We need to do so if we want to use a different database, or if we want another layer of security in between the system and the data.

## KeyCloak Setup

Start by creating the initial admin user:

`docker exec $CONTAINER_ID keycloak/bin/add-user-keycloak.sh -u admin -p admin123`

and then restart the container as instructed, with `docker-compose restart`.

KeyCloak wisely disallows admin console access from anywhere outside localhost. So, from your dev machine, open a tunnel:

`ssh -L 4000:localhost:8010 $MY_SERVER`

Navigate to http://localhost:4000 in your browser and sign in with the initial admin credentials from above.

There's a zillion options! Fortunately we only need a few of them.

1. First, hover over "Master" in the upper-left corner and click "Add Realm." Name your realm. I used "shinyproxy".
2. Create your first user!
    1. Click "Users" in the left sidebar. Create a user. Only Username is required.
    2. Click on your newly created user. Click the "Credentials" tab. Set a temporary password. So you can log in as this user.
3. Click "Clients" in the left sidebar.
4. Click "Create." Name your client application. I used "shinyproxy" again.
5. On the main Settings page:
    1. Turn "Authorization Enabled" ON.
    2. Add https://sp.domain.com/* to "Valid Redirect URIs"
    3. Click "Save"
6. Click the "Credentials" tab in the top tab bar. On this page:
    1. Copy the **Secret**

## ShinyProxy Setup

We're going to build a docker image for ShinyProxy much as described [here](https://github.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-config-examples/tree/master/02-containerized-docker-engine).

Download the Dockerfile in this repo (it should be the same as the [OpenAnalytics one](https://github.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-config-examples/blob/master/02-containerized-docker-engine/Dockerfile)) as well as the `application.yml` file.

Paste the **Secret** from the KeyCloak Credentials page into the eponymous spot in the `application.yml` file.

Run `docker build . -t shinyproxy` and `docker-compose up -d`.

One last piece before we're done: execute `docker pull openanalytics/shinyproxy-demo` to pull the Shiny demo apps that ShinyProxy references in the `application.yml` above.

You should now be able to navigate to `sp.domain.com`, be redirected to `sp-keycloak.domain.com`, log in as the user you created, be redirected back to `sp.domain.com`, and launch a Shiny App.

## Shiny Setup

[Install R / RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

[Create R Shiny application](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html)

[Package it up](https://www.shinyproxy.io/deploying-apps/), but use `FROM rocker/r-base:latest` [rocker/r-base:latest](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker)`

**Hopefully this all works for you!**
